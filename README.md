## Immutable Ledger used in Plenum. 

This codebase provides a very simple, python-based immutable distributed
ledger. Its scope of concerns is fairly narrow; it is not a full-blown
distributed ledger technology like Fabric, but simply provides the persistence
mechanism that Plenum needs. It is intended to be collapsed into the indy-node codebase
over time; hence there is no wiki, no documentation, and no intention to
use github issues to track bugs.

You can log issues against this codebase in [Hyperledger's Jira](https://jira.hyperledger.org).
